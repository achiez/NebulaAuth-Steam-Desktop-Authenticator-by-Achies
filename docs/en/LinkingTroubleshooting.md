# Steam Guard Linking Issue Solution

Some accounts may occasionally face issues when trying to link Steam Guard. It may be impossible to link such accounts without an SMS, and sometimes even with the correct SMS code, it won't be accepted. Common errors include (error names may vary in other SDA clients):

- BadConfirmationCode
- InvalidState
- InvalidStateWithStatus2
- Code did not match
- And others

This error most often occurs when entering the code from an email, but sometimes it can appear when trying to add a phone number or inputting an SMS code.

## Solution (it’s important to follow the steps precisely)

 1. Upon encountering the error, restart the Steam Guard linking process from scratch.
 2. Enter your login and password.
 3. A prompt to enter your phone number will appear. Do not skip this step and enter a real phone number.
 4. Click on the link sent to your email.
 5. Press the "Proceed" button.
 6. From here, one of two things may happen: either an error (of any type) appears, or a request for SMS input:
      - If an error appears (e.g., "Could not confirm email," though it could be another error) – proceed to step 7.
      - If no error appears, and you proceed to the SMS input stage (see step 6.1 below).
           
    **6.1. Important!** Do not enter the SMS code sent to your phone. Close the linking window.
    **6.2. Wait 20 minutes** to allow Steam to "forget" about the phone number in the linking process.
     
    
   
8. At this point, the issue with the account should be resolved.
9. You can now repeat the linking process as usual. The problem is resolved, and the account can be linked either with or without SMS.

If this doesn’t help, try again. However, be aware that after 3-5 failed attempts, Steam may block the linking process for anywhere from one day to a week. To avoid this, it’s best to follow this guide as soon as the issue is detected.
